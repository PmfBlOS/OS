Process creation in Windows.

Processes are created in the Windows API using the CreateProcess() function,
which is similar to fork() in that a parent creates a new child process.
However, whereas fork() has the child process inheriting the address space
of its parent, CreateProcess() requires loading a specified program into the
address space of the child process at process creation. Furthermore, whereas
fork() is passed no parameters, CreateProcess() expects no fewer than ten
parameters.

The C program illustrates the CreateProcess()
function, which creates a child process that loads the application mspaint.exe.
We opt for many of the default values of the ten parameters passed to
CreateProcess().
