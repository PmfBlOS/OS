Named pipes onWindows systems provide a richer communication mechanism
than their UNIX counterparts. Full-duplex communication is allowed,
and the communicating processes may reside on either the same or different
machines. Additionally, only byte-oriented data may be transmitted across a
UNIX FIFO, whereas Windows systems allow either byte- or message-oriented
data. Named pipes are created with the CreateNamedPipe() function, and a
client can connect to a named pipe using ConnectNamedPipe(). Communication
over the named pipe can be accomplished using the ReadFile() and
WriteFile() functions.
